    <h1>Triangles</h1>
    <h2>Properties of Different Triangles</h2>
    <h3>Isosceles</h3>
          <img class="Isosceles" src="images/Isosceles.png" alt="Isosceles Triangle">
      <p>an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length, and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length,</p>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <h3>Equilateral</h3>
              <img class="Isosceles" src="images/download.png" alt="Isosceles Triangle">
      <p>an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.</p>
      <p>an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.</p>

    <h3>Scalene</h3>

      <p>Scalene triangle is a type of triangle which has all its three sides unequal in measure. Eventually, it has all its three angles unequal. Thus, we can say that the lengths of sides as well as measure of angles of a scalene triangle are different.</p>
